# Movie-Search-Application
Project Goal-Develop an interactive console application that allows users to search for movies in a SQL database. 
- A test database of movies  provided as a data source from https://github.com/it-career-hub/MySQL_databases/blob/main/imdb.movies.sql which students  install on a local server.
- All entered search queries are stored in a separate table in a separate database.
- The project application allows to display the most popular queries at the user command.
  Implemented the ability to use main.py to run a console application, while MovieSearch.py will be used to run a web application using Streamlit.
